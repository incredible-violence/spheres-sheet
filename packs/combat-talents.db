{"_id":"1xwTC0UqYoVjYC9W","name":"Rope Swing","permission":{"default":0,"55oRMeK8J5d3pvei":3},"type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>If you have a secured rope, a set piton, thrown a grappling hook, or wrapped a whip or similar weapon around a point, you may use the attached rope or weapon to spring around the battlefield.</p>\n<p>There are five methods for securing a rope:</p>\n<p><strong>Flail Group Weapon:</strong> Weapons from the flails weapon group may be used as if they were a grappling hook, though applying them requires a melee attack roll rather than a ranged attack roll. A length of rope may be used in this way also, taking improvised weapon penalties as appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>Grappling Hook:</strong> You may throw a held grappling hook as a swift action, making a grapple check against a creature or a ranged attack roll against an unattended object. This deals no damage. You may use your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier on this grapple check. A creature may remove a grappling hook as a move action with a Strength or Escape Artist check against this sphere&#8217;s DC or a grapple check against your grapple CMD. The range increment of a grappling hook is improved to 20 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Grappling Weapon:</strong> If you are grappling a creature via the grappling special feature of a weapon, a rope attached to that weapon counts as secure for the duration of the grapple.</p>\n<p><strong>Piton:</strong> You may draw a piton and rope and attempt to set it in an object or creature within reach as a standard action, dealing 1d4 + Strength modifier damage. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must succeed on a melee attack to place the piton on a creature. A creature can remove a set piton as a move action with a Strength check equal to this sphere&#8217;s DC. If you fail to deal damage, your attempt fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Tie:</strong> You also may simply secure a rope to a suitable point within reach (a pillar, post, chandelier, etc.) as a standard action. Any creature within reach may untie this rope as a standard action.</p>\n<p>Once your rope is secured by any of the above methods, you may, as a move action, attempt to move to any other legal square within the rope or weapon&#8217;s reach (as determined from the anchor point), to a maximum of 30 ft. without provoking an attack of opportunity, regardless of your normal move speed, by making a Climb check and comparing the result to the CMD of each creature adjacent to the start and destination points; success on this check allows you to complete the movement, and failure causes you to fall prone in a square adjacent to the creature whose CMD you failed to beat. Use your reach (not threatened area) to determine the maximum movement length when using a weapon from the flail group for this ability. This movement can include squares on elevated or recessed surfaces, or even walls. You may even end this movement on a wall or ceiling if you succeed on a Climb check against the surface&#8217;s DC. You must have a clear path towards the destination (this ability does not allow you to pass through solid obstacles or creatures, though it may allow you to circumvent an enemy if you have a clear path around them within the rope&#8217;s reach).</p>\n<p>You must have a free hand to use this ability. Movement using this ability counts as climbing for the purpose of the (climb) package&#8217;s movement bonuses. For every 4 ranks in Climb you possess, you may move an additional 5 ft. with this talent. If you possess the Mobile Striker talent, you may replace the movement portion of that talent with the movement granted by this talent.</p>\n<p>Ropes or weapons affixed to creatures by any method above allow both the creature to which the rope is affixed (the target) and the creature holding the rope or weapon (the holder) to attempt drag and reposition combat maneuvers against each other. The holder may always choose to drop the rope or weapon as a free action on his turn or as an immediate action off-turn.</p>\n<p>Example: Azeem the conscript is facing a force of kobolds in a tunnel. Two of them, wielding clubs, have moved adjacent to attack him, while two more are behind a barricade 30 ft. down the tunnel with crossbows. Jorr draws (a move action) and throws (a swift action) his grappling hook to attach it to the overhead scaffolding 25 ft. away, then attempts to swing to just behind the crossbow-wielding kobolds to a space 35 ft. from his current position, 10 ft. beyond the anchor point. Jorr must make a Climb check and compare it to the CMDs of all four kobolds, since two are adjacent to his starting position and two adjacent to his ending position. If he succeeds, he moves without provoking attacks of opportunity, springing over the heads of the nearby kobolds, swinging over the barricade and kicking off the tunnel wall to land beyond the far foe.</p>\n<p><strong>Errata:</strong> Releasing or unsecuring a rope after a swing is a free action.

The jet-boosters once activated, grant a fly speed of 60 ft. with poor maneuverability. If the wearer successfully hovers near ground level, she obscures visibility as though she was Large size and had the Hover feat.

You cannot fly while carrying anything other than a light load while in this mode. In addition, this fly speed only allows you to maintain yourself a 3 ft. above the surface of the ground. If you are higher than that on the end of your turn, you glides to 3 ft. above the ground, taking no falling damage. Jet-boosters operated in slow burn do not obscure visibility.</p>\n<p>Jet-boosters can be operated in overdrive, giving the wearer a fly speed of 90 ft. with clumsy maneuverability and consuming 2 charges per round (instead of the normal 1 per round).</p>\n<p>As a standard action, jet-booster canisters may be attached to an unwilling creature with a successful melee touch attack, and activated as part of the same action. At the end of each of your turns, the active jet-boosters will consume a charge and forcefully move the creature 30 feet in a direction of your choice (which can be changed as a movement action by Remote Control). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures with attached jet-boosters can remove them from themselves by spending a standard action on their turn.</p>\n<p>As an alternative the jet-boosters can be designed to function underwater, and grant propulsion underwater the same way they can grant a flight speed above ground, except that creatures gain a swim speed instead of fly speed.

Attaching a clip to a square in your space, yourself, or an object or melee weapon you are holding requires only a move action, which automatically activates the device. Removing an attached clip is a standard action, which immediately deactivates and expends any remaining charges.</p>\n<p>To target an area with the clip, you must successfully make a melee or ranged touch attack (range 15 ft.) against a solid space within range to attach it. Once attached, the clip will automatically activate, causing the clip to create an area of light or heavy gravity (chosen at time of activation) with a radius of up to 5 ft. + 5 ft. for every 2 ranks you possess in Craft (mechanical), and expend a single charge at the start of each round.</p>\n<p>The clip may also be used to normalize gravity. This functions to turn areas of, light, heavy or no gravity into areas of normal gravity. This may be used to provide normal gravity to either an area with a radius of up to 5 ft. + 5 ft. for every 2 ranks you possess in Craft (mechanical) or for a single building, structure or vehicle with a maximum size of Colossal. Using the gravity this way requires a single charge for an hour of use and is a rote function.</p>\n<p>To target a creature with the clip, you must successfully make a melee or ranged touch attack (range 15 ft.) to attach it. Once attached, the clip will activate, causing the creature to act as if in light or heavy gravity (chosen at time of activation), and expend a single charge at the start of each round.</p>\n<p>To target a melee weapon with the clip, you must successfully make a melee or ranged touch attack (range 15 ft.) to attach it. Once attached, the clip will automatically activate, causing the weapon&#8217;s mass to modulate with each successful attack on the moment of impact, via the manipulation of the gravity fields around the weapon. Each successful hit against a target consumes a charge from a gravity clip and causes the damage from the hit to resolve as if the weapon were one size category smaller or larger (chosen at time of activation) than its actual size. This effect does not stack with similar effects, such as those granted by the spell lead blades.</p>\n<p>To target an object that isn&#8217;t a weapon, you must successfully make a melee or ranged touch attack (range 15 ft.) to attach it. Once attached, the clip will automatically activate, causing the object to double or halve its density. Mechanically, this doubles or halves the object&#8217;s weight, and causes the object to count as one category lighter or heavier for the purposes of the Telekinesis sphere and other effects. The clip will expend a single charge at the start of each round.</p>\n<p>You may attach the gravity clip to a different ranged weapon as long as the weapon fires a physical projectile, and use its range increments for its effect, however in that case this ability is no longer a touch attack even if the weapon itself would be.</p>\n<p><strong>Heavy Gravity:</strong> In heavy gravity areas, Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, and Swim checks incur a -2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack rolls. All item weights are effectively doubled, which might affect a character's speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A character's strength and Dexterity scores are not affected. Characters that fall in areas of heavy gravity take 1d10 points of damage for each 10 ft. fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Light Gravity:</strong> Characters in an area of light gravity gain a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls and on Acrobatics and Ride checks. All items weigh half as much, and weapon ranges double. Strength and Dexterity don't change as a result of light gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change.

You can make a turret out of any weapon with a maximum size based on your ranks in Craft (mechanical), see Table: Turret Size below.</p>\n<p>Follow the general rule for weapon sizes (light weapon counts as a Tiny object, a one-handed weapon as a Small object, etc.) when determining the weapons base size however many exceptions apply and are up to the GM to determine. The guideline is that a heavy crossbow is a Small weapon, a hand crossbow is a Tiny weapon, and a shuriken is a Diminutive weapon.</p>\n<p>Consider the turret a 1 HD construct with average hit points, hardness as well as saving throws for a gadget, size equal to the weapon, no ability scores except Strength and Dexterity scores of 10, an AC equal to 10 + 1/2 your ranks in Craft (mechanical), movement speed of 0, a bonus to Perception checks equal to your Craft (mechanical) bonus (with a -5 penalty for lacking a Wisdom score) and a base attack bonus equal to your ranks in Craft (mechanical). Turrets possess no magic item or augment slots.</p>\n<p>The setup or disassembly of a turret takes a full-round action and can be placed on a floor or on walls or ceilings with some ingenuity and extra time (Such as using pitons or glue). Activating a turret is a standard action. Once activated a turret can be given a command as part of the same action to target a specific target. The turret will attack the target to the best of its ability until the target is destroyed (or is out of line sight for 1 round or more) making a single attack with the attached weapon each turn on your initiative. An unmanned turret's bonus to hit with the attached weapon is equal to your practitioner modifier plus 1-1/2 times your ranks in Craft (mechanical). Turrets can reload themselves automatically, but reloading a weapon with a reload time of a standard or full-round action, takes place of their attack for the turn. A turret can only ever make 1 attack per round.</p>\n<p>A turret requires 1 charge per minute of operation (in 1 minute nonconsecutive increments).</p>\n<p>Turrets may also be fired manually. In which case firing it requires the users own actions every time its used in such a way (Such as using a standard action to use a special attack action). The creature activating the gadget uses your base attack bonus + your practitioner modifier (or their own, if higher) when calculating the weapon&#8217;s attack bonus, with the appropriate size modifiers for the weapon&#8217;s size (i.e., -4 for Gargantuan, etc.). When used manually the controller may make attack actions and apply feats and martial talents to attacks made with this Turret as if it were a weapon the controller is wielding even if using the weapon remotely. Weapons used this way are treated both as their base weapon and as technological weapons for purposes of weapon proficiency.</p>\n<p>Turrets may also be integrated into drones as long as they are two sizes smaller than the size of the drone, granting the turret a measure of mobility.

Aligned liquids have the following effects based on their associated alignment:</p>\n<p><strong>Good:</strong> A direct hit by a flask of good aligned liquid deals 2d4 points of damage +1d4 per two ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess to undead creatures or evil outsiders. Each such creature within 5 ft. of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.</p>\n<p><strong>Evil:</strong> A direct hit by a flask of evil aligned liquid deals 2d4 points of damage +1d4 per two ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess to living creatures or good outsiders. Each such creature within 5 ft. of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic:</strong> A direct hit by a flask of chaotic aligned liquid deals 2d4 points of damage +1d4 per two ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess to constructs or lawful outsiders. Each such creature within 5 ft. of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.</p>\n<p><strong>Lawful:</strong> A direct hit by a flask of lawful aligned liquid deals 2d4 points of damage +1d4 per two ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess to elementals or chaotic outsiders. Each such creature within 5 ft. of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.</p>\n<p>You can increase the Craft DC for this weapon in increments of 10; each time you do so, the range for each damage increment increases by 5 ft. (for example, if you increase the Craft DC to 30, you would deal full damage to all affected targets within 5 ft. of the point of contact and 1 point of damage to all other affected creatures within 10 ft.).</p>\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[["Formulae"]],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","long":null},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"featType":"combatTalent","associations":{"classes":[]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"","attack":{"parts":[]},"sphere":"Alchemy","identifiedName":"Aligned Liquid"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Xlprk1mKW6Tde9tx"},"spheres-sheet":{"sphere":"SpheresSheet.SphereAlchemy"}},"img":"modules/spheres-sheet/icons/spheres/alchemy.png","effects":[]}

You may have multiple caravans, but any caravan not accompanied by a PC or cohort is at risk from the various hazards of travel and may not reach its destination, based on the conditions in the region it travels. The GM should roll random encounters, treating combat encounters as dispersing the caravan. Combat encounters with a CR of less than half your ranks in Diplomacy disperse the caravan but cause no permanent losses. Encounters with a CR of at least half your ranks in Diplomacy but not greater than your ranks disperses the caravan and causes 25% losses.

Likewise, talents that grant additional skills to your followers each lend themselves to having one higher ranking follower direct activities (scouting, trade, crafting) of the group of followers.

This expands it to roughly your size, uses a different set of weapon statistics, and grants you a burrow speed equal to your normal speed for that round.

The drill bypasses a point of hardness for every 2 ranks you possess in Craft (mechanical). If you manage to destroy the obstacle with this attack you may continue forward treating the squares of the destroyed obstacle as difficult terrain.

{"_id":"ayjvNAIidHFJuCqG","name":"Troop Subtype","permission":{"default":0,"55oRMeK8J5d3pvei":3},"type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The troop subtype represents an organized group of trained soldiers that act as a unit, rather than as individuals. A troop is something of an abstraction, in that the component creatures that make up the troop are mostly irrelevant; only the troop as a whole matters for the purposes of combat. A troop is similar to a swarm, but is normally composed of Small or Medium creatures. Large groups of Tiny or smaller creatures should use the normal swarm rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Traits:</strong> A troop is not subject to flanking, but it is subject to critical hits and sneak attacks if its component creatures are subject to such attacks. Reducing a troop to 0 hit points or fewer causes it to break up, effectively destroying the troop, though the damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack.</p>\n<p>All troops gain the following traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Troop Subtype:</strong> A troop is a collection of creatures that acts as a single creature, similar to a swarm, but typically as part of a military unit. A troop has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A troop has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single armor class. A troop makes saving throws as a single creature. A single troop occupies a 20-foot-by-20-foot square, equal in size to a Gargantuan creature, though the actual size category of the troop is the same as that of the component creatures. The area occupied by a troop is completely shape-able, though the troop must remain in contiguous squares to accurately reflect the teamwork of trained military units. A troop has a reach equal to that of the component creatures based on size or armament. A troop can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the troop provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A troop can move through any area large enough for its component creatures. The exact number of a troop&#8217;s component creatures varies, but in general, a troop of Small or Medium creatures consists of approximately 12 to 30 creatures. Larger creatures can form troops, but the area occupied by such a troop should increase proportionally according to the size of the component creatures.</p>\n<p>A troop is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Immunity to being Tripped or Bull Rushed:</strong> A troop cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, except by area effects that include such effects. A troop can grapple an opponent.</p>\n<p><strong>Immunity to Single Target Spells:</strong> A troop is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate and multiple target spells such as haste), though it is affected by spells or effects that target an area or a nonspecific number of creatures (such as fireball or mass hold monster).</p>\n<p><strong>Vulnerable to Area Effect Spells:</strong> A troop takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area. If a troop is rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage, it disperses and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Troop Attack:</strong> Creatures with the troop subtype don&#8217;t make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature within reach or whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. A troop&#8217;s stat block has &#8220;troop&#8221; in its Melee entry with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a troop deals is based on its Hit Dice. Unless stated otherwise, a troop&#8217;s attacks are non-magical. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a troop attack&#8217;s damage to 0 or other special abilities can give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to the troop&#8217;s attacks. Some troops also have other special attacks in addition to normal damage. Troops threaten all creatures within their reach or within their area, and attempt attacks of opportunity as normal with their troop attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaos of Combat:</strong> Because of the chaos of combat, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a troop or within its reach requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a successful DC 20 Will save.</p>\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","long":null},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"featType":"combatTalent","associations":{"classes":[]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"","attack":{"parts":[]},"sphere":"Leadership","identifiedName":"Troop Subtype"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.WXebjxv2xuJpJ7r0"},"spheres-sheet":{"sphere":"SpheresSheet.SphereLeadership"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

A cohort may gain any PC feat for which it qualifies. Cohorts may not gain magic item crafting feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Talents:</strong>&nbsp;Cohorts gains talents with the proficient progression.</p>\n<p><strong>Martial Tradition:</strong>&nbsp;Your cohort gains a martial tradition, using the practitioner modifier given by their profession.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong>&nbsp;Just like PCs and Monsters, a cohort gains a permanent +1 bonus to an ability score of your choice for every 4 Hit Dice possessed.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancement:</strong>&nbsp;At 5 Hit Dice, a cohort gains a +2 enhancement bonus to one ability score. At 9th level, they increase this bonus to +4 and gain a +2 bonus to an additional ability score. At 13th level, the first bonus increases to +6, the second to +4, and they gain a +2 bonus to an additional ability score. These bonuses may be retrained as if they were a single feat.</p>\n<p>Talents marked (cohort) grant additional options for your cohorts. Some abilities call out joint actions. These actions require both the user and his cohort to pay the requisite action cost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc5\">Re-Recruiting Cohorts</h3>\n<p>A cohort that leaves your service on good terms is easier to recruit. You may maintain a network of such former cohorts, called contacts, equal to twice your practitioner ability modifier (minimum 2). Such contacts do not normally travel with you beyond reaching the nearest settlement. Each contact will have a place of residence, usually in a settlement but sometimes a wilderness area, ship, or other abode. You may send messages to a contact by whatever means you have available, requesting that they meet you at a particular time and place, allowing you to recruit them. Talents such a Messenger, and legendary talents such as Air Travel, Planisphere, and Teleportation can facilitate getting messages to the contact and their traveling to meet you. Contacts are able to travel to your caravan at the same rate as your Messengers.</p>\n<p>Contacts have lives apart from following you and may on occasion send requests for aid or show up in unexpected places. Unlike a cohort, there is no penalty for the death of a contact. Mindless cohorts may not become contacts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc6\">Roleplaying Cohorts</h3>\n<p>Cohorts are generally under the player's control regarding their mechanical actions, especially during adventures, but they are not mindless automatons. Cohorts that are abused or mistreated will abandon the player when able to do so. Normally, the GM will speak for cohorts. Another option is to allow other players to control some cohorts, investing them in the cohort's development and well-being. The other players could be allowed a degree of latitude to portray a unique personality for the cohort, emphasizing that it is a unique person rather than simply a class ability. This should obviously only be done after consulting with the other players and may not work in all groups. Be aware that this invites the others players' input on how the cohort is used, which may be unwelcome to some players.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","long":null},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"featType":"combatTalent","associations":{"classes":[]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"","attack":{"parts":[]},"sphere":"SpheresSheet.SphereLeadership","identifiedName":"Cohort Package","nonlethal":false,"useCustomTag":false,"conditionals":[],"tag":"cohortPackage"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.A9AT8gObKw9WHU9v"},"spheres-sheet":{"sphere":"SpheresSheet.SphereLeadership"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

When creating these sensors you may always choose to create less sensors than listed.</p>\n<p>Creatures wearing a sensory set are supplied with information from routines uploaded into the gadget (noted in each routine individually).</p>\n<p>When activated with 1 or more charges, the creature gains the use of the sensory set. Each charge allows these additional senses to function regularly for 24 hours.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hearing Set:</strong> This gadget takes the form of a pair of audio sensors that can hear as well as humans. A hearing set can occupy any slot excluding the brain. Failing a Fortitude save against remote control deafens you for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>Smell Set:</strong> This gadget takes the form of an olfactory sensor (usually a nose) that can smell as well as humans. A smell set can occupy any slot excluding the brain. Failing a Fortitude save against remote control nauseates you for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>Taste Set:</strong> This gadget takes the form of a taste sensor (usually a tongue) that can taste as well as humans. A taste set can occupy any slot excluding the brain. This could allow you to taste without ingesting or licking. Failing a Fortitude save against remote control nauseates you for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>Touch Set:</strong> This gadget takes the form of a pair of nerve sensors that can detect pressure, texture, and heat as well as humans. A touch set can occupy any slot, but if it occupies any slot except for the brain or body, the ability to sense applies to that limb only (so applying this augment to a leg would extend any abilities to only the ones done with the leg itself). Failing a Fortitude save against remote control exhausts you for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>Vision Set:</strong> This gadget takes the form of a pair of ocular sensors that can see as well as humans. A vision set can occupy any slot excluding the brain. Failing a Will save against remote control blinds you for 1 round.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, when you select this talent, gain one of the following improvements (not every improvement applies to every sensory set). Some improvements are linked to a sense type, being denied that sense type denies you the improvement as well (blindsense linked to a hearing set is disabled if the wearer is deafened for instance):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blindsense:</strong> This improvement can be applied to and is linked with a hearing, smell, taste, or touch set. While wearing the set the user can spend a charge as a movement action to grant themselves the blindsense special ability with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Extended:</strong> This improvement can be applied to and is linked with a hearing or vision set. As a free action during their turn the user can make their sense extended for 1 round. The user is flat-footed, but Perception check DCs linked to their sense increase by 1 per 30 feet of distance to the target rather than 1 per 10 feet. This increases by an additional 10 feet for every 5 ranks in Craft (mechanical) you possess.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrated:</strong> A single sensory set can grant two senses at once chosen at the time of its creation. The number of senses a set can grant increases by 1 for every 4 ranks in Craft (mechanical) you possess. The sensory set must still still occupy an appropriate slot to function (so a set that grants vision and taste cannot occupy a brain slot), and only requires 1 charge to power its base functionality. In addition you may combine sensory sets with other augments allowing them to occupy the same slot.</li>\n<li><strong>Microvision:</strong> This improvement can be applied to and is linked with a vision set. As a free action during their turn the user spend a charge to make their vision microscopic for 1 hour. The user cannot see further than 30 feet away, but gains a +1 insight bonus to Appraise checks made to determine an item&#8217;s value, Craft checks made to create an item, all Disable Device checks, and Survival checks made to follow tracks. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 ranks in Craft (mechanical) you possess.</li>\n<li><strong>Nightvision:</strong> This improvement can be applied to and is linked with a vision set. The user benefits from low-light vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet. When entering magical darkness that limits vision that the user did not create, they can spend a charge as a free action to make the sensory set attempt a Will save with a +1 bonus for every 5 ranks you possess in Craft (mechanical), opposed by the effect&#8217;s creator&#8217;s magic skill defense to see in such darkness.</li>\n<li><strong>Scent:</strong> This improvement can be applied to and is linked with a smell or taste set. While wearing the set the user can spend a charge as a movement action to grant themselves the scent special ability with a range of 30 feet for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Shielded:</strong> You can gain a +4 circumstance bonus on saves vs. effects that would disable a sense type that your wearing an active sense set for, increased by +1 for every 5 ranks in Craft (mechanical) you possess as a free action by spending an extra charge (for instance being blinded while wearing a vision set).</li>\n<li><strong>Thermal:</strong> This improvement can be applied to and is linked with a touch or vision set. As a movement action the user can spend a charge to amplify their ability to detect heat for 1 minute. The user ignores the miss chance for concealment (including total concealment) from creatures that radiate body heat or are exceptionally cold for their environment (like ice elementals in a jungle), though masking their body can bypass this effect (such as covering yourself in cold mud).</li>\n<li><strong>Tremorsense:</strong> This improvement can be applied to and is linked with a touch set. While wearing the set the user can spend a charge as a movement action to grant themselves the tremorsense special ability with a range of 60 feet for 10 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>X-Ray:</strong> This improvement can be applied to and is linked with a vision set. As a standard action during their turn the user may spend three charges to make their vision x-ray vision for 1 round.

An impaled creature who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a concentration check (DC 10 + your CMB + spell level), or lose the spell. Weapons used to impale a creature cannot be used for attacks except for those against the impaled creature (you cannot impale more than a single creature with your unarmed strikes), ignoring armor, natural armor, and shield bonuses to AC.

When the impaled creature loses the impaled condition, they take bleed damage equal to the damage dice of the weapon used to impale the creature.

To extinguish an instantaneous fire effect or spell, the wielder must use a readied action with the fire extinguisher to counter the effect; this can cancel the entire effect, provided the source of the effect is in the extinguisher&#8217;s area of effect.</p>\n<p>When used against a creature of the fire subtype, a blast from a fire extinguisher deals 1d6 points of cold damage per 2 ranks of Craft (mechanical) (minimum 1d6) (Reflex for half). A breathing creature exposed to a direct blast from a fire extinguisher is not harmed as long as the area is relatively well-ventilated&#8212;using a fire extinguisher in a confined area with poor or no ventilation can result in slow suffocation (at the GM&#8217;s discretion).</p>\n<p><strong>Flashlight</strong><br>\nWhen activated, a flashlight creates a beam of normal light in a 60-ft. cone. You may attach the flashlight to an item slot as part of the same action used to activate the gadget, otherwise the gadget must be held until attached to an item slot as a move action. The direction of the cone is chosen once each round as a free action.</p>\n<p>It also increases the light level in the area beyond this initial cone by one step, out to a 120-ft. cone. It does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. Against magical darkness, the flashlight may expend an additional charge to suppresses the magical darkness (turning it into regular darkness) for 1 minute before the darkness overwhelms the light. In normal conditions, the flashlight uses up 1 charge per 8 hours of use as a rote action and can be integrated into a drone without counting towards the maximum number of integrated gadgets it may possess.</p>\n<p><strong>Respirator</strong><br>\nWhen activated, a respirator forms a mask over the face of the wearer which creates a vacuum seal, scrubbing the air which the wearer breathes out, allowing them to breathe in contaminated areas or oxygen deprived areas (including underwater environments) so long as the respirator has power. Variations of this gadget exist for creatures dependent on different environments. Aquatic creatures for example may have a respirator that allows them to &#8220;breathe&#8221; outside of water. Generally, the respirator gadget does not prevent the use of other head slot items such as circlets, crowns, hats, and hoods. The respirator uses up 1 charge per hour of use. Drones don&#8217;t usually need respirators, however a drone with a integrated respirator may activate theirs for willing adjacent creatures.</p>\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[["Drone"],["Gadget"]],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","long":null},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"featType":"combatTalent","associations":{"classes":[]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"","attack":{"parts":[]},"sphere":"Tech","identifiedName":"Firefighter Equipment"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.6cWC9dppzjwQuWd9"},"spheres-sheet":{"sphere":"SpheresSheet.SphereTech"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

The following revisions should help integrate it.</p>\n<p><strong>Automatic:</strong> This weapon can act as a semi-automatic weapon (see below), or it can fire a burst of shots with a single pull of the trigger to attack all creatures in a line as a full-round action that counts as a special attack. This line starts from any corner of the wielder's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it cannot penetrate. When using an automatic weapon to attack all creatures in a line, the wielder makes a separate attack roll against each creature in the line. Each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not affect an automatic weapon's line attack. Roll to confirm each attack roll that threatens a critical hit separately. A single burst with an automatic weapon consumes 10 charges or uses of ammunition.</p>\n<p>If the wielder of this weapon possesses the Barrage sphere, they can choose to spend their martial focus to make additional line attacks as if making a barrage attack. The same area can be targeted by the same burst twice, and apply (blitz) talents to every creature in said lines.</p>\n<p><strong>Semi-Automatic:</strong> A semi-automatic weapon normally fires one shot as an attack. However, the user can take a special attack action to fire twice, as if using the Barrage sphere's barrage ability (including taking a -2 penalty on all attacks), except using the Barrage sphere this way does not allow the user to expend martial focus for additional attacks. If the wielder has the Barrage sphere's barrage ability, they can instead count their base attack bonus as five points higher exclusively for the purposes of qualifying for additional attacks when martial focus is expended.</p>\n<p><strong>Slow-Firing:</strong> A slow-firing weapon requires a full-round action to use, and thus cannot be used to make iterative attacks or used with attack actions or special attack actions.</p>\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","long":null},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"featType":"combatTalent","associations":{"classes":[]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"","attack":{"parts":[]},"sphere":"Tech","identifiedName":"Superior Mechanical Ranged Weaponry"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.tAW1MyRURYF6Yn3A"},"spheres-sheet":{"sphere":"SpheresSheet.SphereTech"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}
